# Common Fate Terraform Provider

Common Fate Terraform provider using Terraform plugin framework

## Setting up the provider locally

First create a terraformrc file in your home directory by running `touch ~/.terraformrc` and add the following code

- If you already have a terraformrc this step can be skipped

Then open the file just created in your editor of choice and add the following

```
plugin_cache_dir   = "$HOME/.terraform.d/plugin-cache"
disable_checkpoint = true

provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
                "registry.terraform.io/common-fate/commonfate" = "/Users/PATH_TO_GITHUB_REPO/terraform-provider-commonfate"
 }

  direct {}
}
```
- This tells Terraform to use a local copy of the provider over the deployed instance running at `registry.terraform.io`

save and exit.

Then build the provider by running `make provider`
- This will create the binary of the provider in your local directory.

# Running the example Terraform

## Auth 
The provider uses a m2m OIDC flow to authenticate with Common Fate API's. To successfully get creating Common Fate resources you will need to set the following environment variables:

```
TF_VAR_oidc_client_id

TF_VAR_oidc_client_secret
```
- These will be generated by the deployment terraform here... TODO: link to instructions where to find these


`cd` into the `/examples` folder and there are example terraform files that can be used for testing, make sure to `cd` into the example folder.

You should now be able to run `terraform init` and `terraform plan` within the example folders

In the plugins repo.
- Run `make provider` to build a new version of the provider

## Tests

Terraform's official documentation for tests can be found here: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/testing/acceptance-tests

Run the following to run the acceptance tests:

```
TF_ACC=1 go test -v ./...
```

## Debugging
There is a vscode debugging provider called 'Debug Terraform Provider'. Run this and it will return the following message

```
Provider started. To attach Terraform CLI, set the TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS environment variable with the following:

	TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{"registry.terraform.io/common-fate/commonfate":{"Protocol":"grpc","ProtocolVersion":6,"Pid":39056,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"unix","String":"/var/folders/6b/nks_6fns3sj3ljtwcjrt5t840000gn/T/plugin2126076831"}}}'
```

export this env variable to the directory where you are running your terraform code. Then run a plan/apply with breakpoints set and it will catch.
