# commonfate_access_workflow (Resource)

Access Workflows are used to describe how long access should be applied. Created Workflows can be referenced in other resources created.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "commonfate-access_workflow" "workflow-demo" {
  name                     = "demo"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60
  priority                 = "100"
  default_duration_seconds = 30 * 60
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->

## Schema

### Required

- `access_duration_seconds` (Number) The maximum allowable duration for the access workflow

### Optional

- `activation_expiry` (Number) The amount of time after access is activated before the request will be expired
- `default_duration_seconds` (Number) The default duration of the access workflow
- `extension_conditions` (Attributes) Configuration for extending access (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--extension_conditions))
- `name` (String) A unique name for the workflow so you know how to identify it.
- `priority` (Number) The priority that governs whether the policy will be used. If a different policy with a higher priority and the same role exists that one will be used over another.
- `try_extend_after_seconds` (Number, Deprecated) The amount of time after access is activated that extending access can be attempted. As a starting point we recommend setting this to half of the `access_duration_seconds`.
- `validation` (Object) Validation requirements to be set with this workflow (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--validation))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The internal approval workflow ID

### Nested Schema for `extension_conditions`

Required:

- `extension_duration_seconds` (Number) Specifies the duration for each extension. Defaults to the value of access_duration_seconds if not provided.
- `maximum_number_of_extensions` (Number) The maximum number of allowed extensions (set to 0 to disable extensions). If not set, it defaults to 0.

### Nested Schema for `validation`

Optional:

- `has_reason` (Boolean)
