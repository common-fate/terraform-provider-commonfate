# commonfate_access_workflow (Resource)

Access Workflows are used to describe how long access should be applied. Created Workflows can be referenced in other resources created.



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "commonfate-access_workflow" "workflow-demo" {
  name                     = "demo"
  access_duration_seconds  = 60 * 60
  try_extend_after_seconds = 10 * 60
  priority                 = "100"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `access_duration_seconds` (Number) The duration of the access workflow.
- `try_extend_after_seconds` (Number) The amount of time after access is activated that extending access can be attempted. As a starting point we recommend setting this to half of the `access_duration_seconds`.

### Optional

- `activation_expiry` (Number) The amount of time after access is activated before the request will be expired
- `name` (String) A unique name for the workflow so you know how to identify it.
- `priority` (Number) The priority that governs whether the policy will be used. If a different policy with a higher priority and the same role exists that one will be used over another.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The internal approval workflow ID
